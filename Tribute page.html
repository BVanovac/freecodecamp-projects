   <ul>
     <li><strong>Origin</strong></li> 
     In the era of the 80-90s, Tesla had created many innovations. The "Tesla Coil" which he invented in 1891, is widely used today in radio and television sets and other electronic equipment.
     <li><strong>Financing<strong></li> For his new construction project, Tesla acquired land on the cliffs of Long Island Sound. The site was called Wardenclyffe. J. P. Morgan had funded Tesla $150,000, although in reality for the tower to be fully operable more funds were needed in the midst of construction in 1901. This lead to a financial deficit, which in return the plan for the tower was scrapped. Tesla sought European funders, but the Wardenclyffe Tower was never fully operational. It was demolished in 1917. 
       <li><strong>New Tower<strong></li> Today, two Russian physicists — brothers Leonid and Sergey Plekhanov — are raising money to resurrect Tesla's ambitious project, Reuters reports.
